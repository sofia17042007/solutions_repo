## Problem 1: Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

Calculating **equivalent resistance** is a foundational concept in circuit analysis. While traditional methods (series/parallel reduction) work well for small circuits, they can become tedious and error-prone for complex networks.

By applying **graph theory**, we can model any circuit as a **weighted graph**:
- **Nodes** â†’ electrical junctions
- **Edges** â†’ resistors (weights = resistance values)

This method:
- Enables **automated analysis** and simplification
- Provides deeper understanding of circuit structure
- Is suitable for integration in simulation tools and optimizers

## âœ… Task Options

### ðŸ§© OPTION 1: Simplified Task â€“ Algorithm Description

- Describe how to compute equivalent resistance using graph theory
- Provide **pseudocode**:
    - Identify series and parallel patterns
    - Iteratively reduce the circuit
    - Handle **nested combinations** of resistors

---

### ðŸ’» OPTION 2: Advanced Task â€“ Full Implementation

- Implement the full algorithm in a language like **Python**
- Use graph libraries like `networkx` for circuit representation
- Ensure that your program:
    - Accepts **circuit graphs**
    - Handles **arbitrary resistor networks**
    - Produces the **total equivalent resistance**
- Include test cases:
    - Series and parallel
    - Nested configurations
    - Complex circuits with cycles

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Outline

```plaintext
function calculate_equivalent_resistance(graph, source, target):
    while graph has more than 2 nodes:
        for each node n in graph:
            if n is neither source nor target:
                if n has exactly 2 neighbors:
                    perform series reduction
                elif node is part of a simple cycle:
                    perform parallel reduction
    return resistance between source and target
